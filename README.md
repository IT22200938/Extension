## 📦 Installation

> **Important:** This extension uses different manifest files for Chrome/Edge vs Firefox due to Manifest V3 implementation differences.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aura-interaction-tracker.git
   cd aura-interaction-tracker

   ```bash
   # If manifest.json is currently Firefox version, switch to Chrome
   copy manifest-chrome.json manifest.json
   ```

3. **Load in Chrome/Edge**

### Technologies Used

- **Manifest V3**: Modern extension format
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external dependencies
- **Chrome Storage API**: Local data storage
- **Service Workers**: Background processing
- **Content Scripts**: Page interaction tracking

### Permissions Explained

- `storage`: Store interaction data locally in browser
- `activeTab`: Access the currently active tab for tracking
- `<all_urls>`: Track interactions across all websites

### Data Storage

- **Storage API**: `chrome.storage.local`
- **Maximum Storage**: ~1000 interactions (FIFO)
- **Retention**: 7 days (auto-delete older data)
- **Size**: Approximately 5-10 MB maximum

### Performance Considerations

- **Throttling**: Mouse movements throttled to 500ms
- **Scroll Events**: Throttled to 1000ms
- **Efficient Storage**: Old data automatically pruned
- **Minimal Impact**: Lightweight event listeners

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check if tracking is enabled**
   - Open popup and verify toggle is ON
   - Ensure consent was given

2. **Reload the extension**
   - Chrome/Edge: Go to extensions page → Toggle off/on
   - Firefox: `about:debugging` → Reload

3. **Check browser console**
   - F12 → Console tab
   - Look for error messages

### Data Not Appearing

1. **Refresh the popup**
   - Close and reopen the popup
   - Click the "🔄 Refresh" button

2. **Check storage**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Application/Storage tab → Local Storage
   - Look for extension's storage

### Safari-Specific Issues

1. **Extension not appearing**
   - Safari → Preferences → Extensions
   - Enable the extension

2. **Conversion errors**
   - Ensure you're using Xcode 12+
   - Update to latest macOS

3. **Permissions not working**
   - Re-build in Xcode
   - Check Safari's extension permissions

### Performance Issues

1. **Disable mouse movement tracking**
   - Uncheck "Track Mouse Movements" in popup
   - This reduces event frequency

2. **Clear old data**
   - Click "Clear All Data"
   - Or wait for auto-cleanup (7 days)
